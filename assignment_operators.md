## Assignment operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal `(=)`, which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, `x = f()` is an assignment expression that assigns the value of `f()` to `x`.

There are also compound assignment operators that are shorthand for the operations listed in the following table:

| Name                            | Shorthand operator         | Meaning                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Assignment                      | `x = f()`                 | `x = f() `                 |
| Addition assignment             | `x += f()`                | `x = x + f() `             |
| Subtraction assignment          | `x -= f()`                | `x = x - f()`              |
| Multiplication assignment       | `x *= f()`                | `x = x * f()`              |
| Division assignment             | `x /= f()`                | `x = x / f()`              |
| Remainder assignment            | `x %= f()`                | `x = x % f()`             |
| Exponentiation assignment        | `x **= f()`               | `x = x ** f()`             |
| Left shift assignment           | `x <<= f()`               | `x = x << f()`             |
| Right shift assignment          | `x >>= f()`               | `x = x >> f()`             |
| Unsigned right shift assignment | `x >>>= f()`              | `x = x >>> f()`            |
| Bitwise AND assignment          | `x &= f()`                | `x = x & f()`              |
| Bitwise XOR assignment          | `x ^= f()`                | `x = x ^ f()`              |
| Bitwise OR assignment           | `x \|= f()`               | `x = x \| f()`             |
| Logical AND assignment           | `x &&= f()`              | `x && (x = f())`           |
| Logical OR assignment            | `x \|\|= f()`            | `x \|\| (x = f())`         |
| Nullish coalescing assignment    | `x ??= f()`              | `x ?? (x = f())`           |
